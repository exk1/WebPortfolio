I have started to create the skeleton of my portfolio and playing around with the layout.Most of what I have create thus far was to test out different box and header options. I like the idea of having a header that spans the width of the screen and stays fixed at the top of the screen even when scrolling. I potentially will keep the about me and contact section on the main page and have each project description link out to the full summary. I have also been considering changing the project section so that it is by class or by area of interest. As for other interesting design elements I have been using AI technology and asking it for interesting ways to spice up my webpage. One element that I have incorporated and really liked was changing the color of a link when the cursor is hovered over it. To make it more visually appealing I learned that I can put in a transition of the text color and the color it changes to when the cursor is hovered over it. This is rather subtle, but I think it enhances the visual aesthetics more so than the functional aspects.
