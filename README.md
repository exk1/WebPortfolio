# WebPortfolio
For my website portfolio, I currently have all the links and pages working. The layout is nearly finished as I have all of the 
colors and spaces filled. The last few tweaks I expect to make is probably text size, typography, adding headings, and also adding text below my images. The one concern I have is my porfolio page. I am not sure if there is an easy way for someone to enlarge each image without making separate html pages for each photo as I plan to have many. The target audiene is possible job recruiters and those interested in viewing my designs. I aim to have my portfolio page to showcase different design types I've created: brand relevant, informative, for fun etc...
